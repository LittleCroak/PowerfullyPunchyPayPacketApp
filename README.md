# The Powerfully Punchy Pay Packet App

A small console app that is designed to query my TerrificallyTastefulTaxAPI (found here: https://github.com/LittleCroak/TerrificallyTastefulTaxAPI) for tax calculations.

This was built as a learning experience and for some fun. If you have any pointers please let me know.

NOTE: It goes without saying, but just in case: Do not use this app as tax/financial advice.
